Maze Game
This is a browser-based maze game where the player controls a small object ("thingie") and navigates it through a randomly generated maze to reach the goal ("home"). The game supports multiple input methods such as keyboard, touch controls, device tilt, and even gamepad for a more interactive experience.

Features
Random Maze Generation: Each time you play, a new maze is generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
Multiple Control Options:
Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys or WASD to move.
Touch Controls: On-screen buttons for up, down, left, and right.
Device Tilt Controls: Control the "thingie" by tilting your mobile device.
Gamepad Support: Connect your game controller and use it to navigate the maze.
Emoji Feedback: A dynamic emoji updates based on your performance, reacting with happiness, frustration, or other expressions as you play.
Responsive Design: The game adapts to various screen sizes, making it enjoyable on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
How to Play
Start the Game: Open the game in your browser.
Control the Thingie:
Use the arrow keys or WASD to move up, down, left, or right.
On touch devices, tap the on-screen directional buttons.
If supported, you can tilt your device to move the thingie.
You can also use a connected gamepad to control movement.
Navigate the Maze: Your goal is to move the "thingie" through the maze and reach the "home" area while avoiding barriers.
Reach the Goal: Once you reach the "home" area, you win! The maze will reset, and a new challenge begins.
